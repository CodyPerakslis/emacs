* Fundamentals
** What's in a day?
In a day, there is focus. I decide what I want to get out of the day.
This involves writing out my goal and viewing the entire day through that lens.
Now, daily focus is singular, but weekly and beyond is necessarily fragmented.
To do this well, I need to have everything else understood in context of how it impacts the future.

So, every day I decide what is the one thing I want to achieve that day.
How I achieve it can just be a rough guide, when I achieve it is fluid, but I need a target.
A few days of this and I can clarify a weekly target as well. So on for monthly and yearly.
With a target in mind, everything else is non-existant. I can give myself 1-4 hours to "get my affairs in order" for the day,
but the rest is devoted to the one task.

Start small and build. For now, all I will have is the following two components.
  (1) Every day I start with 1 hour of affairs. 
  (2) Every day I pick a single focus for that day that all other effort revolves around.
